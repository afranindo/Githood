Mission:
--------
Most apps for GitHub are so fucking ugly. This is why I've started Githood,
because I want something that I'd like to use. I don't plan on adding lots of
features; I just want this to follow changes on my watched repositories.


Licence:
--------

It's really simple: only I (Jonathan Sterling) can sell this app on the App
Store. You're free to download it from here and install it on your devices or
whatever, I don't care!

If you are feeling magnanimous and want to fork it, that's really cool. When
you've done something neat, send me a pull request so that I can merge it in!
Just know that anything that gets merged in will be included in updates to the
App Store app (contributors will be credited).

I hope that all that seems fair to anyone looking here. I've got to make a
living, but I think that commercial open-source is the way to go.
